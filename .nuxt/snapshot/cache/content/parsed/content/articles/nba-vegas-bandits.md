Thus, a player who only plays for 1 game but scored a lot can have a few metrics skewed, for example, %FG (field goal scored/total field goal attempts). Moreover, a lot of data was already being processed (through a set of formulas).\nFinally, the data obviously is going to skew towards healthy players. For example, LaMelo Ball only played 36 out of 82 games due to a fractured ankle injury.

The first would be to look at a current NBA team’s overall stats, or the stats of all the players combined, to see how they work together to bring home wins for their teams. The second route would be to look at individual player’s overall stats for the previous season and see how those stacked up against players in the same position.

To remedy this problem, players that had multiple rows, had new total rows made summing up all rows they appeared in. The team they ended the season on was listed as their team for the season. A similar problem occurred with player positions, as players who moved teams could also switch positions during the switch. For example during his trade to the Brooklyn Nets, Mikal Bridges went from playing small forward to the shooting guard. The same process was followed as with team switches, with the player’s position being listed as the one he finished the season in. Although these changes may lead to bias down the line, it was decided that this would be the best course of action to minimize the loss of player data in processes that will be described later."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To compare players in each position two comparison groups needed to be made in order to perform a t test later on. Because the aim of any NBA team is to win the most games, the players were divided into those that were a part of the top 15 teams by wins and those in the bottom 15 teams. These groups were further filtered so only the players in the top 25% of minutes played would remain. This would ensure that only players with high contribution to their team winning would be a part of the analysis. For most positions this meant players with less than 1700 minutes played during the course of the season were not considered in our analysis. One consideration that must be taken into account from this method is that by filtering by minutes played, those that were injured during last season will not be looked at, However, if we aim to create a team for the 2023/24 season we agreed it would be ebay to move forward with players that will be ready to field at the beginning of the season and have a good track record from the previous season."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After splitting the dataset into two groups data frames were created for each position, so comparisons would be made between players in one position.

Basic stats like 2 point shots made and total assists were tested, as well as advanced stats like OWS or offensive win share. The alpha level of the tests was set at 0.05 and the null hypothesis was generally that players from the bottom teams had the same average as those in the top team for the stat being tested.

identifying the key winning statistics for each position, we determined that it would be appropriate to build a model (Figure 2) to calculate a weighted score for each player to fairly rank them among their positions. To begin developing the model, we first assigned an equal weighting to the key statistics within each of the five positions. Since the statistical category was already identified to be statistically significant, we determined that this weighting methodology would ultimately allow us to value each statistic equally. After determining the weighting methodology, the statistics of each player were normalized to scale all the statistics to a 0 – 1 range, which allowed for a fair comparison between them.

These expectations were a product of our collective understanding of basketball and were intuitive in nature. For example, looking at the point guard position, we understood that point guard is historically seen as the “quarterback” of the court, distributing the ball to other players to facilitate scoring opportunities. Because of this, we believed that assists and assist percentage would be statistically significant for point guards from top half teams versus bottom half teams. It made intuitive sense to us that better teams would have point guards who can distribute the ball more effectively than worse teams, thus making their assist statistics more significant. However, as can be seen with the results for many of our positions, this wasn’t the case. While at first we found this puzzling, especially for the point guard position, as we discussed our analysis, we came to the realization that, in the case of a point guard, being able to distribute the ball effectively is a prerequisite to the position, and therefore one should expect that any point guard has these skills, regardless of what team they play for."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Moreover, we posited that the stats that we did find statistically significant at each position for better teams versus worse teams show how players on better teams are able to contribute in other areas of the game, in areas that aren’t normally thought of for their given position, and in turn have a positive impact on their team overall. As another example, for small forwards, this is a position that relies a lot on scoring, so our inclination was that two point percentage, three point percentage, points per game, and other scoring stats would likely be significant. However, it turned out that total rebounds, offensive rebounds, and defensive rebounds were all significant, signaling that small forwards on better teams are able to extend their game to other areas aside from scoring, to rebounding, to help their team more than small forwards on worse teams. Due to their ability to both score and rebound, small forwards on better teams contribute more to the game than their counterparts on inferior teams, and this flexibility in their game contributes more to the team overall, therefore impacting their team’s ability to win games. In the case of small forwards specifically, while obviously the ability to score is impactful on a team’s chances of winning, the ability for small forwards on superior teams to rebound gives their teams more scoring opportunities. In this way, small forwards on better teams find more ways to impact the game than their counterparts on worse teams, and therefore, in theory, contribute more to their team’s ability to win.\nWhile we are ultimately limited in our ability to truly measure whether one statistic or another contributes the most to a team’s ability to win games, we believe that the model we constructed gives us the best chance to capture this potential. We believe in the validity of our results because our methodology took into account all available NBA players, from all teams, but we also included certain thresholds for players to qualify for our analysis. For example, when determining which players to analyze at any given position, we wanted to make sure that we were analyzing players who contribute to their team consistently, either as a starter or as a bench player. Therefore, we determined that only players who contributed at or more than the 75th percentile of minutes played at their position in the 2022-2023 season would be analyzed. We came to this decision because we believed that players who did not meet this threshold, perhaps only playing several games over the course of the season, could skew our analysis due to their high potential of outlier statistics. By having a minutes played threshold, we ensured that we were only analyzing players who consistently impacted their team over the season, and that the statistics we were analyzing were more standardized and less biased in nature. Moreover, we wanted to have a homogenous method to split our players into those from “good” teams and those from “bad” teams. To achieve this, we took all of the players from teams that finished in the top 50% of teams for the 2022-2023 season as the “good” group, and vice versa for the “bad” group. This method ensured that we were accounting for all teams in the NBA and their players. We also made sure to have roughly equal sample sizes of players from good teams and bad teams for each position group. We wanted to have equal sample sizes to ensure the fairness of our analysis."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Overall, we were able to successfully determine for each position group which statistics were significantly different between players from good teams versus bad teams, and theorized that these statistics distinguish how players from good teams are able to adapt their games and contribute more to their team overall than players from bad teams, thus contributing to their team’s ability to win games. We are limited by the fact that there is currently no guaranteed statistic that measures a player’s ability to contribute to their team’s ability to win, and ultimately it is the combination of many statistics that determine whether a certain player contributes positively or negatively to their team overall. However, we believe that our sound methodology, measuring all available data at our disposal, breaking teams into good versus bad, and determining thresholds for our final analyses, point to the fact that our findings show how players on winning teams contribute more to their team than players on losing teams, giving an inclination into which types of statistics may be more impactful to a team’s winning percentage at any given position."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"references"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"References:"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.basketball-reference.com/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.basketball-reference.com/"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://hoopshype.com/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://hoopshype.com/"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.samford.edu/sports-analytics/fans/2019/An-Analysis-of-NBA-Teams-Spending-by-Position-for-the-Upcoming-Season","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www.samford.edu/sports-analytics/fans/2019/An-Analysis-of-NBA-Teams-Spending-by-Position-for-the-Upcoming-Season"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"style","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"html .default .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}html .shiki span {color: var(--shiki-default);background: var(--shiki-default-bg);font-style: var(--shiki-default-font-style);font-weight: var(--shiki-default-font-weight);text-decoration: var(--shiki-default-text-decoration);}"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"authors","depth":3,"text":"Authors:"},{"id":"background","depth":3,"text":"Background:"},{"id":"methodology","depth":3,"text":"Methodology:"},{"id":"datasets","depth":3,"text":"Datasets:"},{"id":"analysis","depth":3,"text":"Analysis"},{"id":"player-selection-with-linear-optimization","depth":3,"text":"Player Selection with Linear Optimization"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":3,"text":"Conclusion"},{"id":"references","depth":3,"text":"References:"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:nba-vegas-bandits.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/nba-vegas-bandits.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"VwxSOjvXMM"}
